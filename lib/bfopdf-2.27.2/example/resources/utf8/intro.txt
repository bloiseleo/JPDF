This example demonstrates the improved Unicode abilities of version 1.1 of the Big Faceless PDF Library (http://big.faceless.org/products/pdf), and contains a short paragraph in 27 different languages (taken from the unicode.org website). 

To view the Japanese, Chinese and Korean pages the appropriate Acrobat language pack will need to be installed. All other pages should work in any version of Acrobat 4 and above, as the required font is embedded.


New Unicode features in version 1.1 of the library are:

* Support for Japanese, Chinese and Korean (horizontal only)

* Full bi-directional support for Arabic and Hebrew scripts, including directional overide characters.

* Intelligent line-breaking - handles numeric and East-Asian line-break rules correctly.

* Support for special formatting characters, including Non-Breaking space, Soft Hyphen, Zero-Width space and Zero-Width Non-Breaking space.

* Hebrew combining characters used when available (e.g. ALEF WITH QAMATS)

* Workaround for broken fonts (with widths specified for zero-width characters).

* Automatic word hyphenation if necessary (currently special cases in English only).


Plus, it's also 40% faster than version 1.0.
